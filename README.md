This program is a modification of the code provided to us in class for a simple TicTacToe game.

These modifications fundamentally change the program by extending the TicTacToe game from the traditional 3x3 size to a 5x5 size (or any size from 1 to 100 is possible in this version of the code, but large game sizes are not recommended due to display concerns and the fact that they would take a very long time to complete).

Additional modifications include displaying a window that allows the user to select the game size.

Instructions: Use the spinner to select your desired game size, then press the "Start" button to start the game, or press "Exit" if you wish to close the application.
